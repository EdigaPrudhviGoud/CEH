To find DOS (SYN and ACK) : tcp.flags.syn == 1  , tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0
To find passwords : http.request.method == POST

Check HTTPs traffic means look for SSL/TLS traffic
Edit -> Preferences -> name resolution -> enable IP Addr. to resolve Domain names -> Resolve network(IP) Addr.

Find IP Addr.
Statistics -> conversations -> Look inside IPv4 tab

Change timestamps for pcap to match log files
view -> select(Time display format) -> Select required format

Filter packets based on keywords:
frame contains "login"
smtp and frame contains "MAIL FROM"


Detect DOS/DDOS with Wireshark:
Explanation:
Attacker ----(syn)----> server
Attacker <----(syn-ack)---- server
attacker ----(ack)----> server(Normal communication)
Note:In DOS we don't get ACK
To find DOS (SYN and ACK) : tcp.flags.syn == 1  , tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0

Follow streams: Red=sending    Blue=Response
Select packet -> right click -> follow

File ->export objects -> http }search for .txt files
ip.addr=202.133.48.30
extension -> .pcap(packet capture)

Detect IOT Traffic:
Analysing MQTT(IOT)
MQTT -> Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
1)MQTT Broker -> Receives published topics
              -> Distributes topics to subscribers
              -> keep client connections alive
              -> send Last Will & Testament(LWT) to subscribers if client "Ungracefully disconnected"
2)MQTT Client -> Can publish topics,keep-alive time,retain bit,QoS,LWT
3)Topic -> Name of data
4)Payload -> Actual data
5)Msg -> Topic+payload
6)Quality of service(QoS):  
              -> 0 = At most once -> Transmit msg once
              -> 1 = At least once
              -> 2 = Exactly once
