There are two types of cryptography :
Symmetric:  In symmetric cryptography both users have the same key to encrypt and decrypt the messages.
Asymmetric: In asymmetric cryptography the encryption and decryption keys are different. The encryption key can be used only for encryption, not for decryption and vice versa. The encryption key is called Public key and the decryption key is called Private key.

Why is asymmetric cryptography used?
Well..because it's more secure! If you are using symmetric cryptography and someone takes your key he can encrypt and decrypt messages that you send. While in asymmetric cryptography he can't decrypt the messages you encrypted with the public key. Only the holder of the Private key can decrypt them. Let's give an example :
Alice wants to talk to Google
Google gives Alice the Public key.
Alice encrypts her message with the public key and sends it to Google.
Google decrypts the message with his private key and sends back what Alice wanted.
And that's how the conversation goes...
Note : Symmetric cryptography is faster than asymmetric, but asymmetric is more secure.

Hashes are a long strings of letters and numbers generated by hashing algorithms. They take plain text and make it a hash.
The important thing about hashes is that they are not reversible. There's no way to decrypt/decode a hash.
Popular hashing algorithms are : MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).
That's how the word "hello" looks as MD5 hash : 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
