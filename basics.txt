Cybersecurity Standards and frameworks:

Standards:

    ISO/IEC 27001: A widely adopted international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a framework for implementing and managing security controls.

    NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this framework provides a voluntary set of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk.

    PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Specifically applies to organizations that handle credit card transactions. It outlines security requirements for protecting cardholder data.

    HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Sets standards for protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI) in the healthcare industry.

    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Although primarily focused on data protection and privacy, compliance with GDPR involves implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect personal data.

Frameworks:

    NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Apart from being a standard, it also serves as a flexible framework for organizations to better understand and improve their cybersecurity posture.

    COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies): Developed by ISACA, COBIT provides a framework for governance and management of enterprise IT, including cybersecurity.

    CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security Controls): A concise, prioritized set of cybersecurity best practices developed by a global community of experts. They help organizations defend against pervasive cyber threats.

    MITRE ATT&CK: A framework that categorizes and describes cyber adversary behavior, providing a knowledge base for understanding and improving an organization's defenses.

    Zero Trust Security Model: While not a traditional framework, Zero Trust is a security model that advocates for strict identity verification and no implicit trust, even for insiders.
